# Use the default queries plus security-extended
queries:
  - uses: security-extended

# Exclude specific queries that produce false positives
query-filters:
  # Exclude js/missing-rate-limiting - false positive
  # Our Express routes use middleware-based rate limiting (apiRateLimiter)
  # which CodeQL's static analysis doesn't recognize in middleware chains.
  # See: backend/routes/api.js - all routes have rate limiting middleware applied
  - exclude:
      id: js/missing-rate-limiting
